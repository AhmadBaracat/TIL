#Use Export Command in bashrc to Make Path Persistent

Use `export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$NPM_PACKAGES/bin:$PATH"` instead of `PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$NPM_PACKAGES/bin:$PATH"`

> Recall that we also mentioned that we can "export" variables. When we export an environment variable, it's automatically available in the environment of any subsequently-run script or executable.
